9300001name;Four Year Plan;Plan Quadriennal;;;Vierjahresplan;;;;;;X
9300001desc;1936 was a turning point for the NSDAP and for the economy. Hitler's initial economic policies had been successful. Confidence was high, unemployment was down to 1.6m. Schacht had initially accepted the need for government deficit financing in the reflation of the new economy but he was becoming concerned at the distortion of the economy due to rearmament. He was worried at the increasing strains on the budget and on the mounting balance of trade deficit. Schacht wanted to increase exports and slow the increase in arms expenditure. As Schacht failed to convince Hitler of the necessity for scaling down rearmament, Hitler became impatient with him and put Goering in charge of the second plan for German economic recovery. It became known as the four year plan. This plan is key to our understanding of how far Hitler was creating a war economy in peacetime or actually creating the conditions necessary for war in the future.;1936 a été un tournant pour le parti nazi et pour l'économie.Les premières politiques économiques d'Hitler avaient été des succès. La confiance était élevé, le chômage était tombé à 1,6 m. Schacht avait d'abord accepté la nécessité de financer le déficit du gouvernement par la relance de l'économie nouvelle, mais il devenait préoccupé par la distorsion de l'économie en raison du réarmement. Il était inquiet sur les ponctions de plus en plus sur le budget et sur l'équilibre de montage du déficit commercial. Schacht a voulu augmenter les exportations et ralentir l'augmentation des dépenses d'armement. Comme Schacht n'a pas réussi à convaincre Hitler de la nécessité de réviser à la baisse le réarmement, Hitler est devenu impatient avec lui et à donc nommé Goering en charge du deuxième plan de relance économique allemand. Il est devenu connu sous le nom de plan de quatre ans. Ce plan est essentielle à notre compréhension de la façon dont Hitler a imaginé la création d'une économie de guerre en temps de paix ou comment créer les conditions nécessaires à la guerre dans le futur.;;;1936 war ein Wendepunkt für die Nazi-Partei und für die Wirtschaft. Hitlers anfängliche Wirtschaftspolitik war erfolgreich. Das Vertrauen war hoch, die Zahl der Arbeitslosen sank auf 1,6 Millionen. Schacht hatte zunächst die Notwendigkeit der Defizit Finanzierung zur Belebung der neuen Wirtschaft akzeptiert, aber er war immer besorgt über die Unausgeglichenheit der Wirtschaft aufgrund der Aufrüstung. Er war besorgt über die zunehmenden Belastungen für den Haushalt und darüber, wie man das Handelsbilanzdefizit ausgleichen könnte . Schacht wollte die Exporte steigern und den den Anstieg der Rüstungsausgaben senken. Als Schacht Hitler nicht von der Notwendigkeit, die Rüstungsausgaben zu senken, überzeugen konnte, wurde Hitler unzufrieden mit ihm und übergab Göring die Verantwortung für den zweiten Plan, der wirtschaftlichen Erholung . Er wurde als  Vierjahresplan bekannt. Dieser Plan ist der Schlüssel zum Verständnis, wie weit Hitler bei der Schaffung einer Kriegswirtschaft zu Friedenszeiten war, oder zumindest die notwendigen Bedingungen für einen zukünftigen Krieg schaffte.;;;;;;X

The battle lasted from 10 May 1940 until the main Dutch forces surrendered on the 14th. Dutch troops in the province of Zealand continued to resist the Wehrmacht until 17 May when Germany completed its occupation of the whole nation. The Battle of the Netherlands saw one of the first major uses of paratroopers to occupy crucial targets prior to ground troops reaching the area. The German Luftwaffe utilised paratroopers in the capture of several major airfields in the Netherlands in and around key cities such as Rotterdam and The Hague in order to quickly overrun the nation and immobilise Dutch forces. The battle ended soon after the devastating bombing of Rotterdam by the German Luftwaffe and the subsequent threat by the Germans to bomb other large Dutch cities if Dutch forces refused to surrender. The Dutch General Staff knew it could not stop the bombers and surrendered in order to prevent other cities from suffering the same fate.;La bataille des Pays-Bas faisait partie du cas jaune, l'invasion allemande des Pays-Bas et de la France.

Hitler saw the Games as an opportunity to promote his government and ideals of racial supremacy, and the official NSDAP paper, the Völkischer Beobachter wrote in the strongest terms that Jews and Blacks should not be allowed to participate in the Games. However, when threatened with a boycott of the Games by other nations, he relented and allowed them to participate, and added one token participant to the German teama German woman, Helene Mayer, who had a Jewish father.

It went from Kleve on the border with the Netherlands, along the western border of the old German Empire as far as the town of Weil am Rhein on the border to Switzerland. More with National Socialist propaganda in mind than for any strategic reason, Adolf Hitler planned the line from 1936 and had it built between 1938 and 1940. Opposite the French Maginot Line, the Siegfried Line served a corresponding purpose during the Phoney War.;La ligne Siegfried était un système de défense qui s'étendait sur plus de 630 km (390 miles) avec plus de 18.000 bunkers, de tunnels et pièges à chars. elle s'étalait de Clèves à la frontière avec les Pays-Bas, le long de la frontière occidentale de l'ancien Empire allemand à la ville de Weil am Rhein, à la frontière Suisse.En rélité elle servait plus à des fins de propagande nazie que pour une raison stratégique, Adolf Hitler avait souhaité la ligne à partir de 1936 et l'avait fait construire entre 1938 et 1940.

The first German expedition to Antarctica was the Gauss expedition from 1901 to 1903. It first used a hot-air balloon in Antarctica and also found and named Kaiser Wilhelm II Land. The second German Antarctic expedition (19111912) was led by Wilhelm Filchner with a goal of crossing Antarctica to learn if it was one piece of land. As happened with other such early attempts, the crossing failed before it even began. The expedition discovered and named the Luitpold Coast and the Filchner Ice Shelf. A German whaling fleet was put to sea in 1937 and, upon its successful return in early 1938, plans for a third German Antarctic expedition were drawn up. The third German Antarctic Expedition (19381939) was led by Alfred Ritscher and aimed at finding an area for a German whaling station, as a way to increase Germanys production of fat.  Another goal was to scout possible locations for a German naval base. Two more expeditions were scheduled for 19391940 and 19401941. The second expedition would also investigate the feasibility of naval bases from which Germany could control the South Atlantic and Indian Ocean along with the Drake Passage. Both were cancelled with the outbreak of World War II.;Comme de nombreux autres pays, l'Allemagne a envoyé des expéditions dans la région antarctique dans la fin du 19e et début du 20e siècle, dont la plupart étaient scientifiques.

Vor allem die geplante Schließung der Fettlücke, d. h. die Absicht die Abhängigkeit des Deutschen Reiches vom Import technischer Fette und Nahrungsfette zu beenden, war der Grund für einen Ausbau der Walfangflotte. Im Frühjahr 1938 wurde Kapitän Alfred Ritscher mit der Leitung einer Expedition in die Antarktis betraut. Innerhalb eines halben Jahres gelang es, eine Expedition zusammenzustellen und auszurüsten, welche die topographischen Kenntnisse für die deutsche Walfangflotte schaffen, gleichzeitig ein wissenschaftliches Programm entlang der Küste unter Berücksichtigung von Biologie, Meteorologie, Ozeanographie und Erdmagnetik durchführen, und das bis dahin unbekannte Hinterland durch Vermessungsflüge erkunden sollte.

Flak towers were 8 complexes of large, above-ground, anti-aircraft gun blockhouse towers. These towers were each supported by a radar installation that had a retractable radar dish (the dish was retracted behind a thick concrete and steel dome in order to prevent damage in an air raid). They also served as air-raid shelters for tens of thousands of people and to coordinate air defence. The flak towers, the design of which Hitler took personal interest in and even made some sketches for, were constructed in a mere 6 months. The priority of the project was such that the German national rail schedule was altered to facilitate the shipment of concrete, steel and lumber to the construction sites.;Après le raid de la RAF sur Berlin en 1940, Adolf Hitler ordonna la construction de 3 tourelles antiériennes dans les villes de Berlin, Hambourg, Vienne pour assurer la défense contre une attaque aérienne.

9300016desc;Enigma is an electro-mechanical rotor cipher machine used for the encryption and decryption of secret messages invented by German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. The early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries  most notably by National Socialist Germany before and during World War II. In December 1932, the Polish Cipher Bureau first broke Germany's military Enigma ciphers. Five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, they presented their Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to French and British military intelligence. From 1938, additional complexity was repeatedly added to the machines, making the initial decryption techniques decreasingly successful. Nonetheless, the Polish breakthrough represented a vital basis for the later British effort. During the war, British codebreakers were able to decrypt a vast number of messages that had been enciphered using the Enigma. The intelligence gleaned from this source, codenamed 'Ultra' by the British, was a substantial aid to the Allied war effort.;Enigma est une machine électro-mécanique utilisée pour le chiffrement et le déchiffrement des messages secrets inventé par l'ingénieur allemand Arthur Scherbius à la fin de la Première Guerre mondiale. Les premiers modèles ont été utilisés dans le commerce à partir des années 1920, et adoptée par les services militaires et du gouvernement de plusieurs pays - notamment par l'Allemagne nazie avant et pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale. En Décembre 1932, le polonais Cipher Bureau a éclaté les codes de Enigma Militaire de l'Allemagne. Cinq semaines avant le déclenchement de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, le 25 Juillet 1939, à Varsovie, ils ont présenté leurs technique de décryptage Enigma et des équipements de renseignement militaire français et britannique. À partir de 1938, la complexité a été accru pour les machines, les techniques de décryptage initiales se faisant de moins en moins efficace. Néanmoins, la percée des polonais constituait une base essentielle pour l'effort de guerre britannique plus tard.

Il a été mis en place, non pas par l'armée allemande traditionnelle, mais par le parti nazi sous les ordres d'Adolf Hitler. Elle enrôlait des hommes de force de 16 à 60 ans qui n'étaient pas déjà en service dans une unité militaire dans le cadre d'une garde nationale allemande. L'unité de base était un bataillon de 642 hommes. ces unités sont principalement composées des membres des Jeunesses hitlériennes, des invalides, des personnes âgées, ou des hommes qui avaient auparavant été considérés comme inaptes au service militaire. Goebbels et autres propagandistes dépeint le Volkssturm comme un élan d'enthousiasme et de volonté pour résister. Cela à créé une certaine hausse du morale, mais sapée par le manque visible d'uniformes et d'armes pour le combat.;;;Der Deutsche Volkssturm war ein militärischer Verband im Deutschen Reich, der nach einem von der NSDAP ausgehenden propagandistischen Aufruf an alle 'waffenfähigen Männer im Alter von 16 bis 60 Jahren' gebildet worden war, um den Heimatboden des Deutschen Reiches zu verteidigen, 'bis ein die Zukunft Deutschlands und seiner Verbündeten und damit Europas sichernder Frieden gewährleistet' sei. Ziel des Aufrufs war es, die Truppen der Wehrmacht zu verstärken. Die Bildung des Deutschen Volkssturms wurde am 18. Oktober 1944, dem Jahrestag der Völkerschlacht von Leipzig, publik gemacht und zwei Tage später offiziell verkündet. Dadurch konnten erste Volkssturmverbände propagandawirksam vorgeführt werden, die auf einen Führererlass vom 25. September 1944 hin aufgestellt worden waren.;;;;;;X

9300028desc;Carl von Ossietzky was a German pacifist and the recipient of the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize. He was convicted of high treason and espionage in 1931 after publishing details of Germany's alleged violation of the Treaty of Versailles by rebuilding an air force, the predecessor of the Luftwaffe, and training pilots in the Soviet Union. Ossietzky continued to be a constant warning voice against militarism and National Socialistsm when, in January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor and the National Socialist dictatorship began. Even then, Ossietzky was one of a very small group of public figures who continued to speak out against the NSDAP. On 28 February 1933, after the Reichstag fire, he was arrested and held in so-called protective custody in Spandau prison. Ossietzky's international rise to fame began in 1936 when, already suffering from serious tuberculosis that was not being treated, he was awarded the 1935 Nobel Peace Prize. The government refused to release him so that he could travel to Oslo to receive the prize. Ossietzky's Nobel Prize was not allowed to be mentioned in the German press, and a government decree forbade German citizens from accepting future Nobel Prizes.;Carl von Ossietzky était un pacifiste allemand et le lauréat du prix Nobel de la paix en 1935. Il a été reconnu coupable de haute trahison et d'espionnage en 1931 après avoir publier les détails de violation présumée de l'Allemagne du Traité de Versailles de par la reconstruction d'une armée de l'air, le prédécesseur de la Luftwaffe, et de par la formation des pilotes de l'Union soviétique. Ossietzky a continué à être une voix d'avertissement constante contre le militarisme et le nazisme quand, en Janvier 1933, Adolf Hitler est nommé chancelier et que la dictature nazie a commencé. Même alors, Ossietzky faisait partie d'un groupe très restreint de personnalités publiques qui ont continué à s'élever contre le parti nazi. Le 28 Février 1933, après l'incendie du Reichstag, il a été arrêté et placé en garde à vue soi disant pour sa protection dans la prison de Spandau. La renommée de Ossietzky a commencé à augmenter dans le contexte international lorsque, déjà atteint d'une grave tuberculose qui n'a pas été traitée, il reçoit le prix le Nobel de la Paix en 1935. Le gouvernement a refusé de le libérer pour qu'il puisse se rendre à Oslo pour recevoir le prix. Le prix Nobel d'Ossietzky n'a pas été autorisé à être mentionné dans la presse allemande, et un décret du gouvernement a interdit les citoyens allemands d'accepter les futurs prix Nobel.;;;Carl von Ossietzky war ein deutscher Journalist, Schriftsteller und Pazifist. Als Herausgeber der Zeitschrift Die Weltbühne wurde er im international aufsehenerregenden Weltbühne-Prozess 1931 wegen Spionage verurteilt, weil seine Zeitschrift auf die verbotene Aufrüstung der Reichswehr aufmerksam gemacht hatte. Wegen des berühmt gewordenen Tucholsky-Satzes Soldaten sind Mörder klagte man von Ossietzky ebenfalls an. Ein Gericht wertete im Juli 1932 diesen Satz jedoch nicht als Verunglimpfung der Reichswehr und sprach den bereits Inhaftierten von der neuen Anklage frei.Als engagierter Pazifist und Demokrat wurde er am 28. Februar 1933 durch die Nationalsozialisten erneut verhaftet und im Gefängnis Berlin-Spandau interniert. Bis zuletzt hatte Ossietzky gehofft, dass sich eine Einheitsfront aus Sozialdemokraten und Kommunisten der drohenden Diktatur der Nationalsozialisten entgegenstellen könnte. Er glaubte, dass die NSDAP nach einer Regierungsübernahme an ihren inneren Widersprüchen zerbrechen würde.

9300029desc;British and American forces determined that their air offensives, if planned correctly and executed accurately, would significantly damage German war production, thereby leading to an early end of the war. In early summer of 1943, as the Allies successfully damaged many German factories during the combined bomber offensives, National Socialist leaders realized the need to more aggressively protect their war industries from air attack. Plans for protecting German factories in underground bunkers, caves, tunnels and mines  and moving a large part of its strategic armaments production into the assumed safety of the District of Sudetenland began as early as 1943, but intensive efforts for subterranean dispersal only began in the summer of 1944.

9300032desc;Operation Freshman was the codename given to a British airborne operation conducted in November 1942 during World War II. It was the first British airborne operation conducted using gliders, and its target was the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant in Telemark county, Norway which produced heavy water for National Socialist Germany. By 1942 the German atomic weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor, but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water. The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant, which had been occupied in 1940. When the British government learned of the German nuclear developments, it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon. Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical, and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant, demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden.;L'opération Freshman était le nom de code donné à une opération aéroportée britannique menée en Novembre 1942, pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale.

En 1942, le programme allemand d'armement atomique était presque près d'être en mesure de développer un réacteur nucléaire, mais pour fonctionner le réacteur aurait besoin d'une grande quantité d'eau lourde. La source de l'eau lourde serait l'usine de Norsk Hydro, qui avait été occupée en 1940. Lorsque le gouvernement britannique appris les développements allemands sur le nucléaires, il a été décidé qu'un raid serait lancé pour détruire l'usine et ainsi bloquer les Allemands à l'accès à de l'eau lourde nécessaire pour développer une arme nucléaire. Plusieurs tactiques ont été discutées et rejetées, finalement il a été décidé qu'une petite force aérienne composée de sapeurs des unités du génie royaux attachés à la 1re Division aéroportée allait atterrir en planeur proche de l'usine, pour la démolir avec des explosifs et ensuite s'échapper par la frontière norvégienne en Suède.;;;Die Operation Freshman, die in Zusammenarbeit von britischen Royal Engineers, der Special Operations Executive (SOE) und dem norwegischen Widerstand durchgeführt wurde, hatte die Zerstörung der Produktion und der Bestände an schwerem Wasser zum Ziel.

Bis zum Jahre 1942 war das deutsche Atomwaffenprogramm nah daran, in der Lage zu sein, einen Atomreaktor zu entwickeln, aber um diesen zum Lafuen zu bringen wurden große Mengen an schwerem Wasser benötigt. Die Quelle des Schweren Wassers war das Norsk Wasserkraftwerk, dass 1940 besetzt wurde.

9300038desc;The Reichskonkordat was a treaty between the Holy See and National Socialist Germany, that guaranteed the rights of the Catholic Church in Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli (who later became Pope Pius XII) and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of Pope Pius XI and President Paul von Hindenburg respectively. The Reichskonkordat is the most controversial of several concordats agreed between various states and the Vatican during the reign of Pope Pius XI and is frequently discussed in works that deal with the rise of Hitler in the early 1930s and the Holocaust. The concordat has been described as giving moral legitimacy to the National Socialist regime soon after Hitler had acquired dictatorial powers, and placing constraints on Catholic critics of the regime, leading to a muted response by the Church to National Socialist policies. From a Roman Catholic church perspective it has been argued that the concordat prevented even greater evils being unleashed against the Church. Though the German bishops were unenthusiastic, and the Allies felt it was inappropriate, Pope Pius XII argued to keep the concordat at the end of World War II and the treaty is still in force today.;Le Reichskonkordat est un traité entre le Saint-Siège et l'Allemagne nazie, qui garantissait les droits de l'Eglise catholique en Allemagne. Il a été signé le 20 Juillet 1933 par le secrétaire d'État Eugenio Pacelli (qui devint plus tard le pape Pie XII) et vice-chancelier Franz von Papen, au nom du pape Pie XI et le Président Paul von Hindenburg, respectivement. Le Reichskonkordat est la plus controversée des concordats conclus entre plusieurs Etats différents et le Vatican pendant le règne du pape Pie XI et est souvent abordé dans des uvres qui traitent de la montée d'Hitler au début des années 1930 et la Shoah. Le concordat a été décrite comme donnant une légitimité morale au régime nazi, peu après, Hitler avait acquis des pouvoirs dictatoriaux, et imposait des contraintes sur les critiques catholiques du régime, conduisant à une réponse atténuée par l'Eglise à la politique nazie. Du point de vue de l'église catholique romaine, il a été soutenu que le concordat empêchait des maux encore plus grands contre l'Eglise. Bien que les évêques allemands étaient peu enthousiastes, et que les Alliés ont estimé qu'il était inapproprié, le Pape Pie XII a maintenu le concordat à la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale et le traité est toujours en vigueur aujourd'hui.;;;Das Reichskonkordat ist ein am 20. Juli 1933 zwischen dem Heiligen Stuhl und dem Deutschen Reich geschlossener Staatskirchenvertrag.

Juli 1933 von Staatssekretär Eugenio Pacelli (der spätere Papst Pius XII) und Vizekanzler Franz von Papen im Auftrag von Papst Pius XI und Reichspräsident Paul von Hindenburg unterzeichnet. Hitlers Interesse an dem Reichskonkordat war machttaktischer Natur: Es diente mehr der propagandistischen Beschwichtigung der weitgehend ablehnend eingestellten katholischen Bevölkerung. Inhaltlich sicherte das Deutsche Reich der katholischen Kirche in Deutschland innere Autonomie und die ungehinderte Verbreitung ihrer Schriften zu. Es garantierte die Freiheit des Bekenntnisses und seine öffentliche Ausübung. Außerdem stellte es das Eigentum der Kirche und die katholischen Bekenntnisschulen unter Schutz.

Written in German, not the usual Latin, it was read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches on one of the Church's busiest Sundays, Palm Sunday. It condemned breaches of the Reichskonkordat agreement signed between the National Socialist government and the Church in 1933, criticised National Socialistsm and its elevation of one race above others and, in the opinion of some, contained a veiled attack on Adolf Hitler. Mit brennender Sorge spoke of 'God-given rights' and invoked a 'human nature' that went beyond national boundaries. It stated that rejection of the Old Testament, which some leadersreligious as well as secularadvocated in National Socialist Germany, was blasphemous. The encyclical condemned particularly the paganism of the national-socialism ideology, the myth of race and blood, and the fallacy of their conception of God. It warned Catholics that the growing National Socialist ideology, which exalted one race over all others, was incompatible with Catholic Christianity.;Mit brennender Sorge ('Avec inquiétude brûlante') est une encyclique de l'église catholique du pape Pie XI, publié le 10 Mars 1937.

Elle a déclaré que le rejet de l'Ancien Testament,préconisé par certains dirigeants religieux ainsi que des laïques de l'Allemagne nazie, était blasphématoire. L'encyclique condamnait notamment le paganisme de l'idéologie national-socialisme, le mythe de la race et du sang, et la fausseté de leur conception de Dieu.

Ausgangspunkt für das Schreiben war die Lage der katholischen Kirche im nationalsozialistisch beherrschten Staat nach dem Abschluss des Reichskonkordats aus dem Jahre 1933.  Mit brennender Sorge sprach von 'Gott gegebenen Rechte' und rief eine 'menschliche Natur', die über nationale Grenzen hinaus ging. Sie erklärte die Ablehnung des alten Testaments von einigen Führungskräften im Deutschen Reich für Blasphemie. Die Enzyklika verurteilt insbesondere das Heidentum der Ideologie desNationalsozialismus, den Mythos von Rasse und Blut, und ihre fehlgeleitete Vorstellung von Gott.

9300043desc;Fort Eben-Emael is a Belgian fortress located between Liège and Maastricht, on the Belgian-Dutch border, near the Albert Canal, and designed to defend Belgium from a German attack across the narrow belt of Dutch territory in the region. Constructed in 19311935, it was reputed to be impregnable and at the time, the largest in the world. The fort was successfully neutralized by glider-borne German troops on 10 May 1940. As some of the German airborne troops assaulted the fortress and disabled the garrison and the artillery pieces inside it, others simultaneously captured three bridges over the Canal. Having disabled the fortress, the airborne troops were then ordered to protect the bridges against Belgian counter-attacks until they linked up with ground forces from the German 18th Army. The action cleared the way for German ground forces to enter Belgium, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael.;Fort d'Eben-Emael est une forteresse belge située entre Liège et Maastricht, sur la frontière belgo-néerlandaise, à proximité du canal Albert, et conçu pour défendre la Belgique à partir d'une attaque allemande à travers l'étroite bande de territoire néerlandais dans la région. Construit en 1931-1935, il était réputé pour être imprenable et à l'époque, le plus grand du monde. Le fort a été avec succès neutralisé par les planeurs des troupes allemandes le 10 mai 1940.Pendant que certaines des troupes allemandes aéroportées ont agressé la forteresse et désactivé la garnison et les pièces d'artillerie par l'intérieur, d'autres en même temps ont capturé trois ponts sur le canal. Ayant désactivé la forteresse, les troupes aéroportées ont ensuite été déployé pour protéger les ponts contre les contre-attaques Belges jusqu'à ce qu'ils fassent le lien avec les forces terrestres de l'armée allemande. L'action a ouvert la voie pour les forces terrestres allemandes pour entrer en Belgique, sans être gêné par le feu d'Eben-Emael.;;;Die belgische Festung Eben-Emael wurde in den Jahren 1932 bis 1939 als nördlichste Anlage des Festungsringes Lüttich erbaut und nach dem direkt angrenzenden kleinen Ort gleichen Namens benannt. Die strategische Aufgabe des Forts war es, einem eventuellen Angreifer aus dem Osten längere Zeit Widerstand entgegenzusetzen, bis der Beistand der Alliierten wirken konnte. Dazu sollte es mit seinen Kanonen die Brücken über den Albert-Kanal der drei aus Maastricht nach Belgien herausführenden Straßen sichern. Das Fort galt als uneinnehmbar und war zu jener Zeit das größte der Welt. Das Fort wurde am 10.Mai 1940 erfolgreich von Deutschen Fallschirmjägern, die mit Lastenseglern abgesetzt wurde, erobert.Es landeten die sieben Lastensegler mit insgesamt 56 Soldaten jeweils in unmittelbarer Nähe ihrer Kampfziele auf dem Dach der Festung. Innerhalb von nur wenigen Minuten wurden fast sämtliche Geschütztürme und die gepanzerten Beobachtungsstände mit ihren Schießscharten durch aufgesetzte Hohlladungen zerstört, so dass die Festung blind war. Diese Operation öffnete den Deutschen Bodentruppen den Weg nach Belgien, die nun ungehindert vom Feuer des Forts vordringen konnten.;;;;;;X

Some projects, such as the creation of a great East-West city axis, which included broadening Charlottenburger Chaussee (today Straße des 17. Juni) and placing the Berlin victory column in the center, far away from the Reichstag, where it originally stood, were successfully completed. Others, however, such as the creation of the Große Halle (Great Hall), had to be shelved owing to the beginning of war. Speer designed a new Chancellery, which included a vast hall designed to be twice as long as the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles. Hitler wanted him to build a third, even larger, although it was never begun. A great number of the old buildings in many of the planned construction areas were demolished before the war and eventually defeat stopped the plans.;;;Der Begriff Welthauptstadt Germania wurde im März 1942 durch Adolf Hitler eingeführt. Seitdem steht dieses Synonym für den Gesamtbauplan für die Reichshauptstadt, mit dem sie zum Mittelpunkt eines großgermanischen Weltreichs umgestaltet werden sollte. Adolf Hitler verlieh Speer den eigens geschaffenen Titel Generalbauinspektor für die Reichshauptstadt (GBI) und unterstellte ihm die gleichnamige Behörde, mit der Speer 19371943 den Umbau von Berlin in Teilen durchführte. Die Planungen für Berlin, die ab 1935 bis 1943 erarbeitet wurden, sahen ein Kreuz von zwei breiten Verkehrsachsen vor, die vom Autobahnring durch die Innenstadt wieder zum Autobahnring führen sollten. Anfänglich zwei, später vier Ringe sollten den Verkehr von den Achsen in die Stadtfläche verteilen. An dem Schnittpunkt der Monumentalachsen sollte die Große Halle als zentrale Versammlungsstätte liegen. Insbesondere die Nord-Süd-Achse sollte als Prachtstraße ausgebaut werden. Als Ersatz für die wegfallenden Flächen in der Innenstadt sollten unter anderem im Grunewald eine neue Hochschulstadt sowie im Osten und Süden Berlins völlig neue Stadtteile entstehen.;;;;;;X

The defenses included several hundred large-caliber88 mm (3.46 in) and 105 mm (4.1 in)anti-aircraft guns, and many more small-caliber guns. The latter were concealed in haystacks, railroad cars, and mock buildings.

Nach der Ernennung zum Abwehrchef 1935 nutzte Canaris seine exzellenten Spanischkenntnisse und baute teils persönlich in Spanien ein Spionagenetzwerk auf. Canaris gilt als Hintermann der deutschen militärischen Unterstützung Francos im Spanischen Bürgerkrieg. 1938 erkannte Canaris, dass Hitlers Politik Deutschland zum Untergang führen würden und er begann im Geheimen gegen das Regime zu arbeiten. Am 11. Februar 1944 wurde Canaris seines Amtes als Abwehrchef enthoben. Der Entlassung als Abwehrchef ging eine Reihe von Fehlern der Abwehr voraus. Klagen über eine schlechte Arbeit der Abwehr hatten sich ab 1943 mit den zunehmenden Niederlagen der Wehrmacht gehäuft. So hatte die Abwehr die Vorbereitungen zur Operation Shingle (Landung alliierter Truppen bei Anzio in Italien) nicht erkannt.

9300083desc;During the interwar period, aircraft and tank technologies matured and were combined with systematic application of the German tactics of infiltration and bypassing of enemy strong points. When Germany invaded Poland, Western journalists adopted the term blitzkrieg to describe this form of armoured warfare. These operations were dependent on surprise penetrations (e.g. the penetration of the Ardennes forest region), general enemy unpreparedness and an inability to react swiftly enough to the attacker's offensive operations. During the Battle of France, the French, who made attempts to re-form defensive lines along rivers, were constantly frustrated when German forces arrived there first and pressed on. Academics since the 1970s have questioned the existence of blitzkrieg as a coherent military doctrine or strategy.

Others continue to use the word to describe the style of breakthrough warfare practised by the Axis powers of this period, even if it were not a formal doctrine.;During the interwar period, aircraft and tank technologies matured and were combined with systematic application of the German tactics of infiltration and bypassing of enemy strong points. When Germany invaded Poland, Western journalists adopted the term blitzkrieg to describe this form of armoured warfare. These operations were dependent on surprise penetrations (e.g. the penetration of the Ardennes forest region), general enemy unpreparedness and an inability to react swiftly enough to the attacker's offensive operations.

Plötzliche, schnelle und unerwartete Vorstöße sollten dem Gegner im Idealfall keine Gelegenheit lassen, eine stabile Verteidigung zu organisieren. Damit sollte im Gegensatz zu den unbeweglichen Materialschlachten des Ersten Weltkrieges ein schneller Sieg erreicht werden. Technische Teilaspekte dieses Konzeptes wurden jedoch schon in diesem Konflikt entwickelt, so beispielsweise der Panzer (Großbritannien 1916), Schlachtflieger (Deutsche Schlachtstaffeln ab 1916) sowie spezialisierte Sturmbataillone der Infanterie, die auf deutscher Seite ab dem Frühjahr 1916 zum Einsatz kamen. Initiator der Blitzkriegtaktik auf deutscher Seite im Zweiten Weltkrieg war Generalleutnant Erich von Manstein (später Generalfeldmarschall und Befehlshaber der Heeresgruppe Süd), der die vorgesehenen veralteten Angriffspläne auf Frankreich überarbeitete und einen schnellen Vorstoß schwerer Panzerdivisionen durch die Ardennen plante (später als Sichelschnittplan bezeichnet und im Rahmen des Westfeldzuges im Mai 1940 praktiziert). Nicht untypisch für die Blitzkriege im Zweiten Weltkrieg war, dass angegriffene Truppen so in Bedrängnis kamen, dass sie entweder schnell kapitulierten oder nur unter Zurücklassung ihrer schweren Waffen flüchteten. So fielen der Wehrmacht große Mengen Beutewaffen und unzerstörte Rüstungsfabriken in die Hände.;;;;;;X

Portugal provided Germany with direct overland exports of a wide range of commodities including rice, sugar, tobacco, wheat, potassium chlorate, inflammable liquids and yellow pitch, and Portuguese merchants were also known to be sending industrial diamonds and platinum via Africa and South America. But by far the most important material Portugal had to offer was tungsten. Tungsten carbide was a critical war commodity with numerous applications such as the production of heat-resistant steel, armour plate, armour-piercing shells and high-speed cutting tools. Portugal was Europe's leading supplier of tungsten (and scheelite, another member of the wolframite series of tungsten ore minerals), annually providing Germany with at least 2,000 metric tons between 1941 and mid-1944, about 60 percent of her total requirement.;Like General Franco in Spain, Portuguese President Antonio de Oliveira Salazar was perceived as pro-Axis but walked a fine line between the two sides, who competed fiercely for Portuguese raw materials, generating huge profits for her economy.

Im Zweiten Weltkrieg erklärte sich das Land für neutral, was jedoch nicht den geregelten Handelsverkehr mit sämtlichen Kriegsteilnehmern unterband. Auf Grund des Verkaufs des für die deutsche Kriegswirtschaft lebenswichtigen Wolframs an das Deutsche Reich zwischen 1943 und 1944 verärgerte Portugal Großbritannien, den traditionellen Alliierten des Landes. England übte daraufhin Druck auf Präsident Carmona aus, der demonstrativ Kontakte mit oppositionellen, linksstehenden Kräften innerhalb der Armee suchte. Diese Demonstration verfehlte ihre Wirkung auf Salazar nicht, die deutschfreundliche Politik wurde beendet, die diplomatischen Beziehungen mit dem Deutschen Reich 1944 abgebrochen, den Briten und auch den USA die Einrichtung von Militärbasen auf den strategisch wichtigen Azoren erlaubt. Großbritannien und die USA garantierten darauf die portugiesische Neutralität. Zwar schätzte Salazar weiterhin das faschistische Italien unter Benito Mussolini und auch Spaniens General Francisco Franco, beurteilte Hitler jedoch deutlich negativer. ;;;;;;X

9300098desc;The British Union was a political party in the United Kingdom formed by Sir Oswald Mosley. Over 1931 the party became increasingly influenced by Fascism. The next year, after a January 1931 visit to Benito Mussolini in Italy, Mosley's own conversion to fascism was confirmed. He spent the summer that year writing a fascist programme, The Greater Britain, and this formed the basis of policy of the BUF. With lack of electoral success, the party drew away from mainstream politics and towards extreme antisemitism over 1934-1935, which saw the resignation of members such as Dr. Robert Forgan. Its provocative antisemitic activity in London led to serious, often violent, conflict, most famously at the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936, when over 100,000 anti-Fascists of English, Irish, Jewish and Somali (amongst others) descent successfully prevented the fascists from marching through London's East End. The government was sufficiently concerned to pass the Public Order Act 1936, which banned political uniforms and required police consent for political marches. This act hindered BUF activity, although in the years building up to the war they enjoyed brief success on the back of their 'Peace Campaign' to prevent conflict with Germany. In May 1940, the BUF was banned outright by the government, and Mosley, along with 740 other fascists, was interned.;The British Union was a political party in the United Kingdom formed by Sir Oswald Mosley.

It also caused Japan to withdraw its powerful aircraft carrier force from the Indian Ocean to defend their Home Islands, and the raid contributed to Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's decision to attack Midwayan attack that turned into a decisive rout of the Imperial Japanese Navy by the U.S. Navy near Midway Island in the Central Pacific.;The Doolittle Raid was the first air raid by the United States to strike the Japanese Home Islands (specifically Honshu).

Es war der erste Angriff auf die japanischen Heimatinseln in diesem Krieg und diente vor allem der psychologischen Kriegführung. Der militärische Schlag - als erste Antwort auf Pearl Harbor - gegen die japanischen Hauptinseln in einer relativ frühen Phase des Pazifikkriegs basierte auf einer Studie, die als Ergebnis den Start von zweimotorigen Bombern von einem Flugzeugträger aus in Richtung Japan als möglich erachtete.

Das Wort entstand 1933, als der Prozess der Vereinheitlichung des gesamten gesellschaftlichen und politischen Lebens  also des öffentlichen und privaten Lebens  in der Machteroberungsphase in Deutschland eingeleitet wurde. Ziel war es, bis 1934 den als Zerrissenheit verstandenen Pluralismus in Staat und Gesellschaft aufzuheben. Praktische Anregungen konnte das NS-Regime in Italien gewinnen. Dort hatte ab seinem erfolgreichen Marsch auf Rom (Oktober 1922) Benito Mussolini die Macht ergriffen und vieles zur Gleichschaltung der italienischen Gesellschaft durchgesetzt. Mit der Gleichschaltung strebte man an, die Aktivitäten des Volkes in großen Organisationen zusammenzufassen, die zugleich dem nationalsozialistischen Verständnis des Volkswillens entsprechen sollten. Dies bedeutete die Überführung von Organisationen in die bestehenden NS-Organisationen: Entweder erfolgte die Gleichschaltung auf Anweisung oder in vorauseilendem Gehorsam (sogenannte Selbstgleichschaltung, z. B. Deutscher Hochschulverband, Deutscher Richterbund). Andere Verbände und Organisationen reagierten auf den Druck mit der ersatzlosen Selbstauflösung und Beendigung ihrer Tätigkeit. Allgemein betrachtet war damit die Einschränkung oder der Verlust der individuellen Persönlichkeit beziehungsweise der Unabhängigkeit, Mündigkeit und Freiheit eines Menschen durch Regeln und Gesetze sowie sonstige Maßnahmen der Gleichsetzung und Vereinheitlichung der Massen verbunden.;;;;;;X

At that time it was composed of only three officers and seven former officers plus a clerical staff. The Reichsmarine intelligence staff merged with the Abwehr in 1928.

But perhaps not surprisingly, due to the small size of the organization and its limited importance at that time, it was unsuitable for a more ambitious Army officer. Another possible factor was that naval officers had more foreign experience than their Army counterparts and understood more of foreign affairs. Because of Abwehr-sponsored reconnaissance flights across the border with Poland, Patzig soon had confrontations with Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS.

Das Ergebnis dieser Kampagne war die Prevention of Violence Act (Verordnung über die Prävention von Gewalt) in Großbritannien, das bis in Jahr 1954 in Kraft war. Die Verordnung läufte 1953 ab und wurde 1973 aufgehoben. Es wurde jedoch im Jahr 1974 wieder eingeführt als Prevention of Terrorism Act (Verordnung über die Prävention von Terrorismus), um gegen den Nachfolger des S-Plans, der Provisional IRA, auf britischem Boden zu kämpfen.

Projects earmarked for funding included flood control, repair of public buildings and private residences, and construction of new buildings, roads, bridges, canals, and port facilities. The projected cost of the various programs was fixed at one billion units of the national currency.

Hitler began dictation of the book while imprisoned for what he considered to be 'political crimes' following his failed Putsch in Munich in November 1923. Although Hitler received many visitors initially, he soon devoted himself entirely to the book. As he continued, Hitler realized that it would have to be a two-volume work, with the first volume scheduled for release in early 1925. The governor of Landsberg noted at the time that 'he [Hitler] hopes the book will run into many editions, thus enabling him to fulfill his financial obligations and to defray the expenses incurred at the time of his trial.' After Hitler's rise to power, the book gained enormous popularity. It was in high demand in libraries and often reviewed and quoted in other publications.

Sie erschien in zwei Teilen. Hitler stellte darin seinen Werdegang zum Politiker und seine Weltanschauung dar.

Hitler bekräftigte darin die Geltung des 25-Punkte-Programms der NSDAP, um dieses nicht in innerparteiliche Konflikte zu verwickeln, und bescheinigte der völkischen Bewegung völlige Erfolglosigkeit, um seine NSDAP als moderne, unverbrauchte und zielbewusste Sammelbewegung des nationalistischen, antidemokratischen Lagers der Weimarer Republik darzustellen.;;;;;;X

9300141desc;The Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 Drache ('Dragon' in English) was a helicopter developed by Germany during World War II. After being forced from Focke-Wulf in 1938, Henrich Focke and test pilot Gerd Achgelis formed a new company, Focke-Achgelis, devoted to developing rotary-winged aircraft. Their first successful prototype, the Fa-223, flew independently on August 3, 1940. Although the Fa 223 is noted for being the first helicopter to attain production status, production of the helicopter was hampered by Allied bombing of the factory and only 20 were built. The craft was not fully deployable until 1945. It could cruise at 175 kilometres per hour (109 mph) with a top speed of 182 km/h (113 mph), and climb to an altitude of 7,100 m (23,300 ft). The Drache could transport cargo loads of over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) at cruising speeds of 121 km/h (75 mph) and altitudes approaching 2,440 m (8,010 ft).;The Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 Drache ('Dragon' in English) was a helicopter developed by Germany during World War II.

Die Fl 282 und die Fa 223 waren ab 1941 die ersten Hubschrauber, die in Serie produziert wurden. Henrich Focke, einer der Begründer der Firma Focke-Wulf, hatte mit der Fw 61 bereits einen ersten gebrauchsfähigen Entwurf für einen Hubschraubertyp vorgelegt. Nach Gründung der Firma Focke-Achgelis & Co GmbH durch Henrich Focke und den Deutschen Meister im Kunstflug Gerd Achgelis im Jahre 1937 wurde dann ein einsatzfähiger größerer Hubschrauber entwickelt, der die Musterbezeichnung Fa 223 und den Beinamen 'Drache' erhielt. Nach den Versuchsflügen der Fw 61 mit Hanna Reitsch in der Deutschlandhalle im Jahre 1938 hatte das Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) die Firma Focke-Achgelis mit der Entwicklung eines militärisch brauchbaren Hubschraubers beauftragt, der eine Last von 700 kg heben sollte. Für die Serienproduktion ab 1941 einigte man sich auf die Version Fa 223 E für einen Mehrzweckhubschrauber. Gegen Ende des Krieges wurde auch noch der Betrieb von Weser Flugzeugbau in Berlin-Tempelhof in die Fertigung einbezogen. Alles in allem konnten nur etwa 20 Exemplare gebaut werden.;;;;;;X

September 1939 gegen 12.00 Uhr mittags legte die Athenia unter dem Kommando von Kapitän James Cook in Glasgow zu ihrer letzten Fahrt in Friedenszeiten ab. Um 16.30 Uhr am 2. September wurden mit dreieinhalb Stunden Verspätung die Leinen gelöst. Die Athenia verließ Liverpool ohne Geleitschutz. Ziel war wieder Quebec und Montreal. An Bord befanden sich 315 Besatzungsmitglieder und 1.102 Passagiere. Wegen einer Sondergenehmigung durfte das Schiff 200 Personen mehr aufnehmen, als offiziell zugelassen waren. Aufgrund des drohenden Kriegszustands flohen tausende Menschen aus Europa, darunter ausländische Touristen und Studenten, US-amerikanische Geschäftsleute und vom NS-Regime Verfolgte. Am Abend des 3. September entdeckte der Kommandant des deutschen U-Boots U 30, Kapitänleutnant Fritz-Julius Lemp, das abgeblendet und im Zickzack-Kurs fahrende Schiff. In der Dunkelheit hatte er Schwierigkeiten, das Schiff eindeutig zu erkennen. Zudem war kurz vorher ein Befehl vom Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine empfangen worden, der vor bewaffneten Handelsschiffen (Armed Merchant Cruisers) warnte. Daher hielt Lemp das Schiff für einen Truppentransporter und schoss um 19.40 Uhr drei Torpedos, von denen nur einer traf. Als U 30 eine halbe Stunde später auftauchte, bemerkte Lemp anhand der Notrufe der Athenia, dass er ein unbewaffnetes Passagierschiff torpediert hatte. Lemp erkannte seinen Fehler, lief sofort von der Unglücksstelle ab, ohne Hilfe zu leisten, und setzte auch keinen Funkspruch ab. Die Athenia sank gegen 10.40 Uhr am darauf folgenden Morgen. 112 Menschen kamen durch die Versenkung ums Leben, darunter 27 Männer, 69 Frauen und 16 Kinder. Neben Briten und Kanadiern starben vier deutsche und 28 amerikanische Staatsangehörige. Die meisten Toten waren durch die Explosion nach dem Torpedoeinschlag und durch mehrere verunglückte Rettungsboote zu beklagen.

It received its name from its legal status as an enabling act granting the Cabinet the authority to enact laws without the participation of the Reichstag. The act stated that it was to last for four years unless renewed by the Reichstag. Due to the great care that Hitler took to give his dictatorship an appearance of legality, the Enabling Act was renewed twice, in 1937 and 1941. However, its renewal was practically assured since all other parties were banned.

Spätestens nach Kriegsbeginn wurden die Gesetze durch Verordnungen und schließlich durch Führerbefehle ersetzt, was zu erheblicher Rechtsunsicherheit führte, da die zahlreichen Führerbefehle nicht immer ordnungsgemäß verkündet wurden und sich oft widersprachen.

He also saw Hitler as a potential rival especially as Hitler had made it clear that he wanted a union with Austria  forbidden by Versailles. Austria had a common border with Italy and such a move by Germany would have alarmed Mussolini  if Hitler was a rival. In 1934, Mussolini met Hitler in Venice. The meeting did not go well. For some reason, Mussolini would not use his translator and he was not fluent in German. Secondly, Hitler kept quoting 'Mein Kampf' which bored Mussolini  or the parts he could understand.

9300159desc;In May 1933, the Soviet Union decided to have Sorge organize a spy network in Japan. Collecting intelligence from inside Germany was more dangerous and difficult at the time, so Sorge was sent to Japan to collect information on Germany's plans.

His agents had contacts with senior politicians and through that, to information of Japan's foreign policy. He also recontacted Hotsumi Ozaki who developed a close contact with the prime minister Fumimaro Konoe. Ozaki copied secret documents for Sorge. As the war progressed, it was becoming increasingly dangerous for Sorge to continue his spying work. Nevertheless, in view of the critical juncture of the war, he continued spying. However, due to the increasing volume of radio traffic from one-time pads (used by the Soviets), the Japanese began to suspect a spy ring operating. The Japanese secret service had already intercepted many of his messages and begun to close in. Sorge was arrested on October 18, 1941, in Tokyo. Even under torture, he denied all ties with the Soviets. The Japanese made three overtures to the Soviets, offering to trade Sorge for one of their own spies.

Er war während des Zweiten Weltkriegs als Journalist und Spion für die Sowjetunion in Japan tätig. Sein Pseudonym lautete R. Sonter, sein GRU-Deckname 'Ramsay'. 1924 reiste er nach Moskau, wo er seine Kontakte zum sowjetischen Geheimdienst verstärkte. Er informierte den sowjetischen Nachrichtendienst u. a. über den Antikomintern-Pakt zwischen dem Deutschen Reich und Japan und warnte vor dem Angriff auf Pearl Harbor. Am 21. Juni 1941 und zwei Tage vor dem Angriff der Wehrmacht auf die Sowjetunion (Unternehmen Barbarossa) warnte er die GRU mit genauen Informationen über den Tag, die Stärke und die Richtungen des Angriffs, die jedoch von Stalin als Fehlinformationen ignoriert wurden. Vor der Schlacht um Moskau übermittelte Sorge die Information, dass Japan die Sowjetunion nicht, wie befürchtet, im Fernen Osten angreifen würde. Durch diese kriegsentscheidende Information konnte Marschall Schukow Truppen aus Sibirien abziehen und den deutschen Vormarsch 25 km vor Moskau stoppen. Bei Chimki, einem Ort an der Moskauer Stadtgrenze auf dem Weg zum Flughafen Scheremetjewo, erinnert noch heute ein Denkmal an jenen Wendepunkt der Weltgeschichte. Zum Verhängnis wurde ihm vielmehr die Observierung japanischer Exilkommunisten durch die japanische Geheimpolizei Tokk?, in deren Verlauf eine seiner Kontaktpersonen enttarnt wurde. Sein Gehilfe Ozaki wurde am 15. Oktober, Sorge selbst am 18. Oktober 1941 verhaftet. Am Jahrestag der Oktoberrevolution, dem 7. November 1944, wurden Richard Sorge und Ozaki Hotsumi in Japan gehängt.

He became the first to win the heavyweight championship (at that time vacant) by disqualification in 1930, after opponent Jack Sharkey knocked him down with a low blow in the fourth round. A rematch in 1932 saw Sharkey gaining the title from Schmeling by a controversial fifteen-round split decision. In 1933, Schmeling lost to Max Baer by a tenth-round TKO. The loss left people believing that Schmeling was past his prime. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP took over control in Germany, and Schmeling came to be viewed as a 'National Socialist puppet.'

A rematch in 1932 saw Sharkey gaining the title from Schmeling by a controversial fifteen-round split decision. In 1933, Schmeling lost to Max Baer by a tenth-round TKO. The loss left people believing that Schmeling was past his prime. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party took over control in Germany, and Schmeling came to be viewed as a 'Nazi puppet.' In 1936, Schmeling knocked out American rising star Joe Louis, placing him as the number one contender for Jim Braddock's title, but Louis got the fight and knocked Braddock out to win the championship in 1937. In his native land, Schmeling was regarded as a hero and promoted by the Nazi propaganda machine as a perfect example of German supremacy over the rest of the world by virtue of his stunning defeat of the current champion, Louis. The government ordered parades and rallies in his honor. He became a friend to Hitler and other powerful figures in the government and also a popular subject of newspaper articles and films. Joseph Goebbels proclaimed Schmeling's victory a triumph for Germany and Nazism: 'Schmeling's victory was not only sport. It was a question of prestige for our race.';;;Max Adolph Otto Siegfried Schmeling war ein deutscher Schwergewichtsboxer und zwischen 1930 und 1932 Boxweltmeister im Schwergewicht. Er gilt bis heute als einer der populärsten Sportler Deutschlands. Am 2. August 1924 begann Schmeling mit einem Kampf gegen Hans Czapp in der Tonhalle in Düsseldorf seine Profi-Boxkarriere, die ihn frühzeitig und mehrmals nach New York führte  der damaligen Hochburg des Profiboxens. Am 24. August 1926 wurde Schmeling durch einen Sieg gegen Max Diekmann Deutscher Meister im Halbschwergewicht. 1927 errang Max Schmeling seinen ersten großen Titel, im Kampf gegen den Belgier Fernand Delarge in der Dortmunder Westfalenhalle wurde er Europameister. 1928 ging er mit seinem deutschen Manager Arthur Bülow nach New York, 'um die Welt zu erobern'. Am 19. Juni 1936 kämpfte er in New York gegen den 'Braunen Bomber' Joe Louis, der damals als unschlagbar galt, aber noch nicht Weltmeister war. Schmeling analysierte Filme seines Gegners und fand einen Schwachpunkt: Louis ließ nach dem Schlag seine Linke fallen, was Platz für einen Konter bot. Im Kampf überraschte Schmeling die Boxwelt, indem er Louis schon früh hart treffen konnte und ihn dann durch K.O. in der 12. Runde besiegte. In den Kinos wurde der Kampf unter dem Titel 'Max Schmelings Sieg  ein deutscher Sieg' vorgeführt. Durch den Sieg über Joe Louis war Max Schmeling zum Herausforderer des amtierenden Weltmeisters Jimmy Braddock avanciert.;;;;;;X

Schmeling continued to press for a chance at a rematch with Louis and in the meantime padded his record against overmatched fighters Ben Foord and Steve Dudas. In 1938, champion Joe Louis announced that he would indeed face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, African-American roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on June 22, 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and clutched onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later and the fight was stopped. When he returned to Germany, Schmeling was now shunned by the National Socialists. During World War II, he would serve as an elite paratrooper (Fallschirmjäger).;In 1936, Max Schmeling knocked out American rising star Joe Louis, placing him as the number one contender for Jim Braddock's title, but Louis got the fight and knocked Braddock out to win the championship in 1937.

Schmeling wurde dabei sowohl von deutscher als auch von internationaler Seite als Vertreter des inzwischen an die Macht gekommenen NS-Regimes gesehen. Diesmal beging Louis nicht mehr den Fehler der tiefliegenden, linken Hand, schlug lange Geraden zu Schmelings Kopf, und trieb ihn gleich zu Beginn der Runde zurück. Schmeling ging mehrmals zu Boden, stand jedoch immer wieder auf, bevor der Kampf schließlich durch die Intervention von Schmelings Trainer Max Machon abgebrochen wurde. Louis gewann souverän in der ersten Runde. Dies war Schmelings letzter Boxkampf in den USA. Am 2. Juli 1939 gewann Schmeling gegen Adolf Heuser zum letzten Mal die Europameisterschaft im Schwergewicht. Im Jahr 1940 meldete er sich zum Dienst in der Wehrmacht. Schmeling wurde als Fallschirmjäger am 20. Mai 1941 beim ersten Angriff auf die von Großbritannien verteidigte Mittelmeerinsel Kreta (Luftlandeschlacht um Kreta) eingesetzt. Schmeling verletzte sich bei der Landung, wurde im Lazarett behandelt und anschließend 'nicht-kv' (nicht-kriegsdienstverwendungsfähig) geschrieben. Aufgrund seiner Verletzung wurde Schmeling Ostern 1943 aus der Wehrmacht entlassen und bis Ende des Krieges zum Dienst in Kriegsgefangenenlagern eingesetzt.;;;;;;X

The program soon spread to cover most of the United States and provided workers for the agricultural labor market (with the notable exception being Texas, which initially opted out of the program in preference to an 'open border' policy, and was denied braceros by the Mexican government until 1947 due to perceived mistreatment of Mexican laborers). As a corollary, the railroad bracero program was independently negotiated to supply U.S. railroads initially with unskilled workers for railroad track maintenance but eventually to cover other unskilled and skilled labor.

Sie wurde durch den 'Beauftragten für den Vierjahresplan' Hermann Göring angeordnet. Die Planung und Vorbereitung oblag Ministerialrat Helmuth Wohlthat. Die Expedition wurde vorwiegend aus wirtschaftlichen Erwägungen durchgeführt, um der deutschen Walfangflotte neue Fanggründe zu sichern und so die 'Fettlücke', d. h. die Abhängigkeit des Deutschen Reiches vom Import technischer Fette und Nahrungsfette, zu verringern. Es bestand die Absicht, eine Grundlage für eine spätere deutsche Besitzergreifung eines Antarktis-Sektors zu schaffen, daher wurden die Vorbereitungen für diese Expedition unter strengster Geheimhaltung getroffen. Das Zielgebiet der Expedition war die Region zwischen 20° West und 20° Ost. Die Deutsche Antarktische Expedition erreichte am 19. Januar 1939 das Arbeitsgebiet an der Prinzessin-Martha-Küste. In sieben Messbild-Flügen zwischen dem 20. Januar und 5. Februar 1939 konnte mit Reihenbildkameras eine Fläche von ca. 350.000 km² photogrammetrisch aufgenommen werden. Dabei entdeckte man bisher völlig unbekannte, eisfreie Gebirgsregionen im Küstenhinterland. An den Umkehrpunkten der Flugpolygone wurden Metallpfeile mit Hoheitszeichen abgeworfen, um deutsche Besitzansprüche zu begründen (die allerdings niemals erhoben wurden). Bei zusätzlichen acht Sonderflügen, an denen auch Ritscher teilnahm, wurden besonders interessante Regionen gefilmt und mit Farbfotos aufgenommen. An Bord der Schwabenland und an der Küste auf dem Meereis konnten biologische Untersuchungen durchgeführt werden. Die Ausrüstung ließ jedoch weder Schlittenexpeditionen auf das Schelfeis noch Landungen der Flugboote in der Gebirgsregion zu. Die Erkundungen erfolgten also, ohne dass ein einziges Expeditionsmitglied das Territorium betreten hat. Die eingesehene und überflogene Region zwischen 10° W und 15° O wurde von der Expeditionsleitung 'Neuschwabenland' getauft. Zwischenzeitlich hatte die norwegische Regierung durch eine Indiskretion der Ehefrau des stellvertretenden Expeditionsleiters Ernst Herrmann gegenüber dem norwegischen Geologen Adolf Hoel Informationen über die deutschen Aktivitäten erhalten und den gesamten Sektor zwischen 20° W und 45° O am 14. Januar 1939 als Dronning Maud Land zu norwegischem Territorium erklärt, ohne dessen südliche Erstreckung zu definieren. Auf Wunsch des Oberkommandos der Marine unternahmen Besatzungsmitglieder am 18. März eine Landung auf der brasilianischen Insel Trindade, um zu prüfen, ob U-Boote dort unauffällig mit frischem Wasser und Nahrung versorgt werden konnten. Dabei erlitt die Landungsmannschaft in einer kleinen Bucht Schiffbruch und musste nach einer Kletterpartie gerettet werden. Da die Landung unter strengster Geheimhaltung abgelaufen war, erschien hierüber nichts in Ritschers gedrucktem Bericht. Am 11. April 1939 lief die Schwabenland wieder im Hamburger Hafen ein. Bis 1942 fertigte Otto von Gruber detaillierte topografische Karten vom östlichen Neuschwabenland im Maßstab 1:50.000 und eine Übersichtskarte Neuschwabenlands an. Unter den neu entdeckten Gebieten waren beispielsweise die nach dem Eislotsen der Expedition Otto Kraul benannten Kraulberge.

In the aftermath of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, with the westward expansion of the USSR in 1939 and 1940 into Poland, the Baltic, and Bessarabia, the decision was made to abandon the line in favour of constructing the Molotov Line further west, along the new border of the USSR. A number of Soviet generals felt that it would be better to keep both lines and to have a defence in depth, but this conflicted with the pre-World War II Soviet military doctrine. Thus, the guns were removed, but were mostly in storage as the new line began construction. The 1941 Axis invasion caught the Soviets with the new line unfinished and the Stalin Line largely abandoned and in disrepair.

Sie bestand aus einer Vielzahl von Betonbunkern, welche über leichte sowie schwere Bewaffnung verfügten. Sie erstreckte sich über die gesamte Westgrenze von der Ostsee bis zum Schwarzen Meer. Sie verlief von Narwa und Pskow über Witebsk, Mogilew, Gomel und Schitomir sowie entlang des Dnjestr bis Odessa. Nach der Besetzung Ostpolens 1939, das im Hitler-Stalin-Pakt der sowjetischen Interessensphäre zugeschlagen worden war, sowie der Besetzung Bessarabiens und der baltischen Staaten 1940, verschob sich die Westgrenze der Sowjetunion um ca. 300 Kilometer nach Westen. Stalin befahl an der neuen Grenze die sogenannte Molotow-Linie zu errichten und dafür die Stalin-Linie aufzugeben. Trotzdem bereitete die Stalin-Linie nach dem Angriff auf die Sowjetunion dem Vormarsch der deutschen Wehrmacht erhebliche Probleme. Zwar war die Molotow-Linie noch nicht fertiggestellt und die Stalin-Linie teilweise entwaffnet, aber im südwestlichen Teil der Stalin-Linie gelang es der Roten Armee, die deutschen Truppen mehrere Tage am Vormarsch zu hindern. In diesem Abschnitt waren die Verluste bei der Überwindung der gut getarnten Befestigungen sehr hoch.;;;;;;X

9300185desc;The Kreisau Circle was the name given to a group of men who opposed Adolf Hitler and the NSDAP. While the NSDAP tried to give the appearance that it was highly popular party and regime from 1933, Hitler had never been universally popular among the armys officer corps nor among the aristocratic families of Germany. The Kreisau Circle came within both of these groups. Its two primary leaders were Helmuth James von Moltke, a great-grandnephew of the Prussian field marshal general and Peter Yorck von Wartenburg, the descendant of an old Prussian noble family. They used the Moltkes estate in Kreisau, Silesia for their early meetings and believed that they needed to plan for Germanys future and this oriented around the removal of Hitler from power and the destruction of the NSDAP. As World War Two loomed and the grip of the state apparatus tightened, the men in the Kreisau Circle became involved in an extremely dangerous situation. Despite this they released their 'Basic Principles for the New Order' in August 1943. It was a statement of intent for what they perceived would be a new Germany that would exist without Hitler or the NSDAP. The mass round up of suspects after the July 1944 Bomb Plot and the subsequent torture of these suspects led to the Gestapo gaining the names of many plotters or supposed plotters  including men in the Kreisau Circle. Yorck von Wartenburg was arrested, tried, found guilty and executed in August 1944. Von Moltke had already been arrested in January 1944 and tried before the Peoples Court. Found guilty of treason, he was executed in January 1945.;The Kreisau Circle was the name given to a group of men who opposed Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.

Der Kreis, dessen Führungspersönlichkeiten Helmuth James Graf von Moltke und Peter Graf Yorck von Wartenburg waren, bildete sich im Jahr 1940. Die theoretischen Grundlagen wurden von häufig zusammentreffenden Arbeitsgruppen in langen Gesprächen entworfen. Der angestrebte föderalistische Staatsaufbau sah allgemein und direkt gewählte Gemeinde- und Kreistage mit weitreichenden Kompetenzen vor, deren Mitglieder die Landtage und den Reichstag wählen sollten. Durch ein an Persönlichkeiten statt an zentral geleiteten Parteien orientiertes Wahlsystem hoffte der Kreis, die Stärkung der Demokratie von der Basis aus zu erreichen. Nach der Verhaftung Moltkes Anfang 1944 löste sich der Kreisauer Kreis de facto auf, einige Kreisauer schlossen sich der Gruppe um Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg an. Nach dessen Attentat auf Adolf Hitler am 20. Juli 1944 gelang es der Gestapo, die Arbeit des Kreises aufzudecken. Sie nannte die Widerstandsgruppe nach Moltkes Gut Kreisau in Schlesien 'Kreisauer Kreis'  vermutlich wurde der Begriff von Theodor Haubach während seiner Vernehmungen benutzt  und prägte damit den Namen, der später Eingang in die Geschichtsschreibung fand.;;;;;;X

The term GlassSteagall Act, however, is most often used to refer to four provisions of the Banking Act of 1933 that limited commercial bank securities activities and affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms. The Banking Act of 1933 joined together two long-standing Congressional projects: (1) a federal system of bank deposit insurance championed by Representative Steagall and (2) the regulation (or prohibition) of the combination of commercial and investment banking and other restrictions on 'speculative' bank activities championed by Senator Glass as part of a general desire to 'restore' commercial banking to the purposes envisioned by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Although the 1933 Banking Act thus fulfilled Congressional designs and, at least in its deposit insurance provisions, was resisted by the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Administration, it later became considered part of the New Deal.

9300195desc;The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men from relief families, ages 1825. A part of the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it provided unskilled manual labor jobs related to the conservation and development of natural resources in rural lands owned by federal, state and local governments. The CCC was designed to provide jobs for young men, to relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the Great Depression in the United States while at the same time implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory. In nine years 3 million young men participated in the CCC, which provided them with shelter, clothing, and food, together with a small wage of $30 a month. The American public made the CCC the most popular of all the New Deal programs. During the time of the CCC, volunteers planted nearly 3 billion trees to help reforest America, constructed more than 800 parks nationwide and upgraded most state parks, updated forest fire fighting methods, and built a network of service buildings and public roadways in remote areas. By 1942, with World War II and the draft in operation, need for work relief declined and Congress voted to close the program.;The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was a public work relief program that operated from 1933 to 1942 in the United States for unemployed, unmarried men from relief families, ages 1825.

9300196desc;The Public Works Administration (PWA), part of the New Deal of 1933, was a large-scale public works construction agency in the United States headed by Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes. It was created by the National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933 in response to the Great Depression. Its goals were to provide employment, stabilize purchasing power, and help revive the economy. The PWA became, with its 'multiplier-effect' and first two-year budget of $3.3 billion (compared to the entire GDP of $60 billion), the driving force of Americas biggest construction effort up to that date. By June 1934 the agency had distributed its entire fund to 13,266 federal projects and 2,407 non-federal projects. For every worker on a PWA project, almost two additional workers were employed indirectly. The PWA accomplished the electrification of rural America, the building of canals, tunnels, bridges, highways, streets, sewage systems, and housing areas, as well as hospitals, schools, and universities. Every year it consumed roughly half of the concrete and a third of the steel of the entire nation. Some of the most famous PWA projects are the Triborough Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel in New York City, the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state, the longest continuous sidewalk in the world along 6 miles of Bayshore Blvd. in Tampa, Florida, and the Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, to the mainland.

However, the letter was largely written by Leo Szilard in consultation with fellow Hungarian physicists Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner. The letter suggested that the U.S. should begin its own research because of the potentially vast destructive power of atomic bombs. Einstein, Szilard, Teller and Wigner were among a number of concerned scientists who initially feared National Socialist Germany would develop the weapon first. After reading the letter, Roosevelt stated that the letter required action, and authorized the creation of the Advisory Committee on Uranium. The Advisory Committee on Uranium did not vigorously pursue development of a weapon, and the work of fission research was taken over by the Manhattan Engineering District in 1942. It directed a full-scale bomb development program. Einstein did not work on the Manhattan Project, the project to develop atomic bombs, because General Leslie Groves considered him to be a security risk because of his pacifist leanings. Einstein later regretted having signed the letter because it led to development and use of the atomic bomb against civilian populations.

Das Mount Rushmore National Memorial ist ein Denkmal, das aus monumentalen Porträtköpfen der vier (bis zur Zeit seiner Erstellung) als am bedeutendsten und symbolträchtigsten geltenden US-Präsidenten besteht. Jedes Porträt ist 18 m hoch. Dargestellt sind von links nach rechts die Präsidenten George Washington (1. US-Präsident), Thomas Jefferson (3.), Theodore Roosevelt (26.) und Abraham Lincoln (16.). Vor dem Denkmal sind Ausschnitte aus berühmten Reden der vier Präsidenten auf Schrifttafeln zu lesen. Das Mount-Rushmore-Nationaldenkmal wird auch als Shrine of Democracy (Heiligenschrein der Demokratie) bezeichnet. Die Lakota-Indianer sehen das Monument hingegen als Entweihung ihres heiligen Berges an. Lincoln Borglum setzte die Arbeiten noch einige Monate fort, bis sie im Oktober 1941 aus Geldmangel eingestellt wurden und das Monument am 31. Oktober 1941 für vollendet erklärt wurde.

It was never an organized political party and had no official standing within the Army. As the economic growth Japan had enjoyed during World War I ended in 1927 with the Showa financial crisis, social unrest increased with the labor unions increasingly influenced by socialism, communism and anarchism, whereas the industrial and financial leaders of Japan continued to get wealthier through their inside connections with politicians and bureaucrats. The founders of the Kodoha were Sadao Araki and his protégé Jinzaburo Masaki. Araki was a noted political philosopher within the Army, who linked the ancient bushido code of the samurai with ideas similar to European fascism to form the ideological basis of his philosophy, which linked the Emperor, the people, land and morality as one and indivisible. The Kodoha envisioned a return to an idealized pre-industrialized, pre-westernized Japan, in which the state was to be purged of corrupt bureaucrats, opportunistic politicians, and greedy capitalists. The state would be run directly by Emperor Hirohito in a 'Showa Restoration' assisted by the military.

It was organized by a group of young Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) officers with the goal of purging the government and military leadership of their factional rivals and ideological opponents. Although the rebels succeeded in assassinating several leading officials and in occupying the government center of Tokyo, they failed to assassinate Prime Minister Keisuke Okada or secure control of the Imperial Palace. However, former Prime Minister Saito Makoto and his predecessor Takahashi Korekiyo were assassinated, along with several other top-rank politicians targeted by the rebels. The coup supporters in the army made attempts to capitalize on their actions, but divisions within the military, combined with Imperial anger at the coup, meant they were unable to achieve a change of government. Facing overwhelming opposition as the army moved against them, the rebels surrendered on 29 February. Unlike earlier examples of political violence by young officers, the coup attempt had severe consequences. After a series of closed trials, 19 of the uprising's leaders were executed for mutiny and another 40 imprisoned.

Der Pakt sah eine militärische Zusammenarbeit und unbedingte gegenseitige Unterstützung im Fall eines Krieges vor, wobei die Vertragsverpflichtungen auch für einen Angriffskrieg galten. Für den deutschen Polenfeldzug, der unmittelbar am Tag nach der Unterzeichnung des Stahlpakts geplant wurde, gingen die Deutschen daher von einer italienischen Beteiligung aus.

The 14th Flak Division responsible for protecting Leuna had 28,000 troops, 18,000 RAD personnel. The reliance of Germany on oil and oil products for its war machine would be identified even before the war and strategic bombing would started with RAF attacks on Germany. ;;;1926 begann in Leuna die Herstellung von synthetischem Benzin, nach dem Bergius-Verfahren aus Kohle hydriert. Es bestand die Gefahr, dass dies eine der größten Fehlinvestitionen werden würde, weil die Herstellungskosten immer höher waren als bei herkömmlichem Benzin. Mittelfristig war ohne Subventionen des Staates die Benzinsynthese nicht überlebensfähig. Die I.G. Farben beteiligte sich an diesem Wahlfonds mit 400.000 Reichsmark und überwies die Summe an die NSDAP am 28. Februar 1933, dem Tag nach dem Reichstagsbrand. Die neue Regierung schloss 1933 mit der I.G. Farben das Feder-Bosch-Abkommen über eine Absatz- und Mindestpreisgarantie für 350.000 Tonnen synthetisches Benzin und bewahrte so das Unternehmen vor insgesamt 300 Millionen Reichsmark Verlust. Bis 1937 waren nahezu alle Direktoren der I.G. Farben Mitglieder der NSDAP. Die I.G. Farben expandierte stark, auch durch Arisierungen, zum Beispiel des vormaligen Konkurrenten Aussiger Verein. Ihr gehörten zu Spitzenzeiten in Deutschland 200 Werke, sowie etwa 400 deutsche und 500 ausländische Unternehmensbeteiligungen. Aufgrund dieser Expansion wurde die I.G. Farben seinerzeit das größte Unternehmen Europas und das viertgrößte der Welt (nach General Motors, US Steel und Standard Oil).;;;;;;X

9300241desc;Direct conversion of coal to synthetic fuel was originally developed in Germany. The Bergius process was developed by Friedrich Bergius, yielding a patent in 1913. Karl Goldschmidt invited him to build an industrial plant at his factory the Th. Goldschmidt AG in 1914. The production began only in 1919. Indirect coal conversion (where coal is gasified and then converted to synthetic fuels) was also developed in Germany by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch in 1923. In 1937, the four central Germany lignite coal plants at Böhlen, Leuna, Magdeburg/Rothensee, and Zeitz, along with the Ruhr Area bituminous coal plant at Scholven/Buer, had produced 4.8 million barrels (760×103 m3) of fuel. During the war, Germany used synthetic oil manufacturing to produce substitute (Ersatz) oil products by using the Bergius process (from coal), the FischerTropsch process (water gas), and other methods (Zeitz used the TTH and MTH processes). Synthetic fuel grades included 'T.L. [jet] fuel', 'first quality aviation gasoline', 'aviation base gasoline', and 'gasoline - middle oil'. 'Producer gas' and diesel were synthesized for fuel as well (e.g., converted armored tanks used producer gas).

In 1898 Gorky's collection Sketches and Stories was published by a radical press and the author was an immediate sensation. These romantic tales concern the vigor and nobility of the Russian peasants and workers. About 1900 he turned to writing novels of social realism. Of these, Mother (1906) had the greatest impact on Soviet literature. Describing the awakening of revolutionary feeling in an ill-treated peasant woman, it became the prototype of the revolutionary novel. At this time Gorky became close friends with Leo Tolstoy and Chekhov. Gorky donated most of his income to the revolutionary movement. He was arrested frequently but treated carefully because of his tremendous popularity. Although philosophically at odds with Lenin, Gorky was able to extract from him aid for many intellectuals and artists in an era of intellectual restriction.

With the increase of Stalinist repression and especially after the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, Gorky was placed under unannounced house arrest in his house near Moscow.

The first Volk product to be announced was the Volksempfaenger, the 'people's radio'. Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels, who had a talent for manipulating media and imagery, was among the first to recognize the power of radio as a tool of propaganda. To limit the ability of Germans to hear alternate points of view, the VE 301 did not have shortwave capabilities, and it became illegal to listen to foreign broadcasts. By 1938 nearly 70 percent of Germans who worked in the cities owned a radio.;;;Im Dritten Reich wurde der Arbeiter für den Beitrag zur deutschen Geschichte gefeiert. In den 1930er Jahren war Hitler frustriert, dass der durchschnittliche deutsche Arbeiter keinen Zugang zu den gleichen Produkten hatte, die im industrialisierten Amerika für gewöhnlich waren  Dinge wie Kühlschrank, Radio und Autos. In der Tat hatte diese Tatsache zur Deutschlands Unterlegenheit im Ersten Weltkrieg beigetragen, die mit dem Glauben der Dolchstoßlegende der Nationalsozialisten geknüpft war. Um dieses Problem zu lösen nutzte Hitler die Autorität des Regimes, um die Industrialisierung zu optimieren damit man genormte, einfache Versionen von Konsumprodukten zu entwerfen. Nach der Propaganda sollten diese Produkte einen höheren Lebensstandard des Volkes erzielen. Das erste Volksprodukt war der Volksempfänger. Der Minister für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, der ein Talent hatte Medien zu manipulieren, sah als einer der Ersten die Macht des Radios als ein Werkzeug der Propaganda. Um die Fähigkeit der Deutschen einzuschränken andere Sender zu hören verfügte der VE 301 über keinen  Kurzwellenempfänger und es wurde illegal ausländische Radiosender anzuhören. Um 1938 besaßen fast 70 Prozent der Deutschen, die in Städten arbeiteten, ein Radio.;;;;;;X

9300267desc;In 1941, German industry and inter-European imports would supply enough food, fuel. and ammunition to support a partly motorized army of about three million men in a great field campaign, planned to last about seventeen weeks. With almost a year to prepare, produce, and stockpile for Barbarossa, the Germans had enough fundamental materials of war to win in the Soviet Union in 1941. The German logistical problem was how to transport material from adequate stockpiles to an army operating under difficult circumstances in a large country without normal-gauge railways and with unpaved roads. The Germans would center logistics on the construction of rail lines and station installations. They would also organize great truck forces to move materials from stockpiles on the frontier until the new rail lines could be completed and rail heads (i.e., train stations where supplies were stockpiled) could be established in the Soviet Union. The Germans organized great logistical truck forces behind each army group to pick up supplies from the frontier rail heads and deliver them into truck dumps as close as possible to the advancing field armies. The truck forces, broken down into flexible 60-ton-capacity columns of vehicles to move supplies, would operate back and forth from the frontier stockpiles until the new train stations and German-gauge rail lines could support traffic into the Soviet Union to forward rail heads. ;In 1941, German industry and inter-European imports would supply enough food, fuel. and ammunition to support a partly motorized army of about three million men in a great field campaign, planned to last about seventeen weeks.

Beinahe ein Jahr dauerte die Vorbereitung, Produktion und das Horten für Barbarossa. Durch diese umfangreichen Vorbereitungen hatten die Deutschen genug fundamentale Materialien, um einen Krieg gegen die Sowjetunion im Jahr 1941 zu gewinnen. Das deutsche Logistikproblem lag hauptsächlich in der Frage wie man diese Materialien aus den Lagern zu den operierenden Armeen unter schwierigen Umständen transportieren musste, in einem Land ohne normale Spurweiten und unbefestigten Straßen. Die Deutschen würden für die Logistik hauptsächlich Eisenbahnlinien verlegen und Stationen bauen. Sie würden auch große LKW-Truppen organisieren, um die Materialien aus den Lagern zur Front zu transportieren bis die Eisenbahnlinien und Stationen für das Horten von Materialien in der Sowjetunion fertiggestellt werden. Die Deutschen organisierten große logistische LKW-Truppen hinter jeder Armeegruppe, um Nachschub aus den Vorratsstationen zu den vorrückenden Feldeinheiten so nah wie möglich zu liefern. Die LKW-Truppen waren in 60-Tonnen-Einheiten gegliedert, die hin und her an der ganzen Front Nachschub lieferten bis die neuen Zugstationen und Spurweiten fertiggestellt waren, damit diese dann den Nachschub in die Sowjetunion leiten konnten.;;;;;;X

Dies hatte zur Folge, dass die japanischen Exporte auf ein Sechstel zurückgingen. Dies heizte die Stimmung in Japan an. Vor allem ein Zwischenfall, bei dem 1932 in Shanghai fünf japanische Mönche misshandelt wurden (ein Mönch erlag später seinen Verletzungen), wurde von den japanischen Medien aufgegriffen und schürte den Zorn in der japanischen Bevölkerung. Am 29. Januar bombardierte Japan daraufhin China und es kam zur ersten Schlacht um Shanghai. Dies war das erste Flächenbombardement gegen eine Zivilbevölkerung. Schätzungen sprechen von etwa 18.000 getöteten Chinesen und 240.000 Obdachlosen. China sah sich gezwungen, den Handelsboykott aufzuheben. Um Shanghai wurde eine demilitarisierte Zone errichtet. Im Mai 1932 vereinbarten die beiden Parteien einen Waffenstillstand, doch die Japaner setzten ihren Vormarsch fort. 1933 wurden die Provinzen Rehe und Chahar besetzt, 1935 musste China einer Pufferzone zwischen Mandschukuo und Peking zustimmen, in der die Japaner den aus kollaborierenden chinesischen Militärs bestehenden Autonomen Militärrat von Ost-Hopei (Hebei) einsetzten. 1936 wurden Teile der Inneren Mongolei besetzt.

In 1940, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King pledged to limit Canada's direct military involvement in the war. Many Canadians supported Mackenzie King's pledge, even as it became obvious the war would not be quickly resolved. As in the First World War, young French-Canadians joined the few traditional French-speaking regiments of the Canadian army. By 1941 there were enough volunteers for five overseas divisions. Meanwhile the Conservatives were pressuring King to advise that the Governor General introduce conscription. In April 1942 a plebiscite was held, which asked the population not to support immediate conscription, but rather to allow the government to take back its promise made during the 1940 election. Following the successful plebiscite, a number of Quebec Liberal MPs left the party to protest, many of whom joined the Bloc populaire canadien. After campaigns in North Africa and Europe, combined with a lack of volunteers, Canada faced a shortage of troops. King finally agreed to a one-time levy of 17,000 NRMA conscripts for overseas service.

9300275desc;The German plan in the Soviet Union was to win a quick war, before the Soviet superiority in numbers and industry could take effect, and before the Red Army officer corps, decimated by Stalins Great Purge, could recover. Barbarossa's task was to destroy as much of the Soviet armed forces as possible, west of the Dnieper River in the Ukraine in a series of encirclement operations so as to prevent a Soviet retreat into the wastes of Russia, and hope that it would be enough to force a Soviet collapse. Then, the Wehrmacht could 'mop up' the remaining Soviet forces beyond the Dniepr. The Luftwaffe was essential in the kind of operations the German Army was going to fight. Its primary mission was not direct close air support, but operational-level interdiction. This entailed attacking enemy logistics, communications, and air bases. Air raids on Soviet war-making potential were forbidden by Hitler for it made little sense to destroy industry that would soon be in Axis hands. In order for the German Army and Luftwaffe bombers to operate effectively in their roles, the first task of the Axis was to eliminate the Soviet air force and deny the enemy the means to interfere with their operations. Once these operations had been carried out, close air support could be rendered to the army. Therefore the Germans deliberately targeted Soviet fighter air bases first, to knock out potential opposition to its bombers and dive bombers. The first attacks began at 03:00 on 22 June. The Soviets had been caught by surprise, their aircraft bunched together in neat rows which were vulnerable. The results were devastating. At the end of the day, German reports claimed 1,489 Soviet aircraft destroyed on the ground alone.;After an initial series of disasters and the loss of almost of all of its pre-war military equipment, many first-echelon units and huge portions of the western USSR, Soviet command was forced to rely on barely trained conscripts to fill gaps on the front.

9300280desc;The battles of the Afrika Korps were largely fought in the rocky desert plain of Cyrenaica, what is now modern day Libya. Conditions in the desert were harsh: miserably hot during the day, while temperatures dropped precipitously at night. Sand storms made flying impossible, and travel by land difficult. Navigation was by compass, and each man had one. Even the short trip to the latrine could result in a man being lost if he forget to take his compass with him when a sand storm was flying.

Conditions in the desert were harsh: miserably hot during the day, while temperatures dropped precipitously at night. Sand storms made flying impossible, and travel by land difficult. Navigation was by compass, and each man had one. Even the short trip to the latrine could result in a man being lost if he forget to take his compass with him when a sand storm was flying.

In 1938, Hobart was sent to form and train 'Mobile Force (Egypt)' although a local general resisted his efforts. While sometimes referred to as the 'Mobile Farce' by critics, Mobile Force (Egypt) survived and later became the 7th Armoured Division, famous as the 'Desert Rats'. Sir Archibald Wavell dismissed Hobart into retirement in 1940, based on hostile War Office information due to his 'unconventional' ideas about armoured warfare.

Therein Adolf Hitler promoted 12 generals to the rank of field marshal for their role in the swift victory over France and the Low Countries.

9300300desc;The Sturmgeschütz III (StuG III) assault gun was Germany's most produced armoured fighting vehicle during the war. It was built on the chassis of the proven Panzer III tank, replacing the turret with a fixed casemate and mounting a more powerful gun. Initially intended as a mobile, armoured light gun for direct-fire support for infantry, the StuG was continually modified and was widely employed as a tank destroyer. It originated from German experiences in the Great War when it was discovered that during the offensives on the western front the infantry lacked the means to effectively engage fortifications. The artillery of the time was heavy and not mobile enough to keep up with the advancing infantry to destroy bunkers, pillboxes, and other minor obstacles with direct fire. Although the problem was well known in the German army, it was General Erich von Manstein who is considered the father of the 'Sturmartillerie' (assault artillery). This is because the initial proposal was from (then) Colonel Erich von Manstein and submitted to General Ludwig Beck in 1935, suggesting that Sturmartillerie units should be used in a direct-fire support role for infantry divisions. On June 15, 1936, Daimler-Benz AG received an order to develop an armoured infantry support vehicle capable of mounting a 75 mm (2.95 in) artillery piece. Overall, Sturmgeschütz series assault guns proved very successful and served on all fronts as assault guns and tank destroyers. Because of their low silhouette, StuG IIIs were easy to camouflage and a difficult target. Sturmgeschütz crews were considered to be the elite of the artillery units and claimed to have knocked out 20,000 tanks by 1944.

9300301desc;Several years before the war, the Germans foresaw the great potential for aircraft that used the jet engine constructed by Hans Joachim Pabst von Ohain in 1936. After the successful test flights of the world's first jet aircraftthe Heinkel He 178within a week of the Invasion of Poland to start the war, they adopted the jet engine for an advanced fighter aircraft. As a result, the Messerschmitt Me 262 was already under development as Projekt 1065 (P.1065) before the start of the war. The project originated with a request for a jet aircraft capable of one hour's endurance and a speed of at least 850 km/h (530 mph). The progression of the original design was delayed greatly by technical issues involving the new jet engine. Funding for the jet engine program was also initially lacking as many high-ranking officials thought the war could easily be won with conventional aircraft. Among those were Hermann Göring who, as head of the Luftwaffe, cut the engine development program to just 35 engineers in February 1940. The aircraft made its first successful flight entirely on jet power on 18 July 1942. In mid-1943, Adolf Hitler envisioned the Me 262 as a ground-attack/bomber aircraft rather than a defensive interceptor against the Allied bombers destroying large parts of Germany, further extending the delay in bringing the Me 262 Schwalbe into operation. About 1,400 Me 262s were eventually produced, but a maximum of 200 were operational at the same time.

9300315desc;On May 15, 1933, the Main Office for Press and Propaganda of the German Student Union proclaimed a nationwide 'Action against the Un-German Spirit,' which was to climax in a literary purge by fire. Local chapters were to supply the press with releases and commissioned articles, sponsor well-known Nazi figures to speak at public gatherings, and negotiate for radio broadcast time. On the 8th of April, the Student Union also drafted the Twelve Theses which deliberately evoked Martin Luther and the historic burning of 'Un-German' books at the Wartburg festival on the 300th anniversary of the posting of Luther's Ninety-Five Theses. The theses called for a 'pure' national language and culture. In a symbolic act of ominous significance, on 10 May 1933, the students burned upwards of 25,000 volumes of 'un-German' books, such as Jewish or American novels. Presaging an era of state censorship and control of culture. On the night of 10 May, in most university towns, nationalist students marched in torchlight parades 'against the un-German spirit.' The scripted rituals called for high Nazi officials, professors, rectors, and student leaders to address the participants and spectators. At the meeting places, students threw the pillaged and unwanted books into the bonfires with great joyous ceremony, band-playing, songs, 'fire oaths,' and incantations.

9300339desc;Rationing is the controlled distribution of scarce resources, goods, or services, or an artificial restriction of demand. The first modern rationing systems were brought in during the First World War. In Germany, suffering from the effects of the British blockade, a rationing system was introduced in 1914 and was steadily expanded over the following years as the situation worsened. Ration Stamps were redeemable stamps or coupons, and every family was issued a set number of each kind of stamp based on the size of the family, ages of children, and income. Rationing often included food and other necessities for which there is a shortage, including materials needed for the war effort such as rubber tires, leather shoes, clothing, and gasoline.;Rationing is the controlled distribution of scarce resources, goods, or services, or an artificial restriction of demand.

9300344desc;Operation Bernhard was the codename of a secret plan devised by the RSHA and the SS to destabilise the British economy by flooding the country with forged Bank of England £5, £10, £20, and £50 notes. The plan was directed by, and named after, Schutzstaffel Sturmbannführer (SS Major) Bernhard Krüger, who set up a team of 142 counterfeiters. Beginning in 1942, the work of engraving the complex printing plates, developing the appropriate rag-based paper with the correct watermarks, and breaking the code to generate valid serial numbers was extremely difficult. By April 1945 the printing press had produced 8,965,080 banknotes with a total value of £134,610,810. The notes are considered among the most perfect counterfeits ever produced, being almost impossible to distinguish from the real currency. The plan was to destabilize the British economy during the war by dropping the notes from aircraft, on the assumption that most Britons would collect the money and spend it, thus triggering inflation.;Operation Bernhard was the codename of a secret plan devised by the RSHA and the SS to destabilise the British economy by flooding the country with forged Bank of England £5, £10, £20, and £50 notes.

Nevertheless, the German government chose to declare war on the United States, partially in response to previous acts of Anglo-American cooperation such as the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, Lend-Lease, the Atlantic Charter, the hand over of military control of Iceland from the United Kingdom to the United States, and the extension of the Pan-American Security Zone. The German declaration of war also came as a great relief to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who feared the possibility of two parallel disconnected wars (UK and Soviet Union versus Germany in Europe, US versus Japan in the Pacific).

9300347desc;When Chamberlain became Prime Minister relations between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State had been strained since the 1932 accession of the new Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera. The Anglo-Irish Trade War, sparked by the withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement. Ireland sought to overturn other aspects of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, most notably the issue of partition, as well as obtaining full control of the three 'Treaty Ports' which had remained in British control. Britain, on the other hand, wished to retain the Treaty Ports, at least in time of war and to obtain the money that Ireland had agreed to pay. The main reason for the retention of the ports was the recent U-boat Campaign around Irish coasts during World War I, and a concern that it might re-occur. As part of the agreements signed in 1938, the ports were returned to Ireland. The issue of partition was not resolved, but the Irish agreed to pay £10 million to the British. There was no provision in the treaties for British access to the Treaty Ports in time of war, but Chamberlain accepted de Valera's oral assurance that in the event of war the British would have access. The agreements were attacked by Conservative backbencher Winston Churchill in Parliament for surrendering the Treaty Ports which Churchill described as the 'sentinel towers of the Western Approaches.' When war came, de Valera denied Britain access to the Treaty Ports under Irish neutrality.;When Chamberlain became Prime Minister relations between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State had been strained since the 1932 accession of the new Irish Prime Minister Éamon de Valera.

9300351desc;Following Germany's swift and successful occupation of France and the Low Countries and growing impatient with Britain's outright rejection of his recent peace overtures, Hitler issued Führer Directive No. 16, setting in motion preparations for a landing in Britain. He prefaced the order by stating: 'As England, in spite of her hopeless military situation, still shows no signs of willingness to come to terms, I have decided to prepare, and if necessary to carry out, a landing operation against her. The aim of this operation is to eliminate the English Motherland as a base from which the war against Germany can be continued, and, if necessary, to occupy the country completely.' Hitler's directive set four conditions for the invasion to occur: (i) The RAF was to be 'beaten down in its morale and in fact, that it can no longer display any appreciable aggressive force in opposition to the German crossing,' (ii) The English Channel was to be swept of British mines at the crossing points, and the Strait of Dover must be blocked at both ends by German mines, (iii) The coastal zone between occupied France and England must be dominated by heavy artillery, (iv) The Royal Navy must be sufficiently engaged in the North Sea and the Mediterranean so that it could not intervene in the crossing.

The fully assembled guns weighed nearly 1,350 tonnes, and could fire shells weighing seven tonnes to a range of 47 kilometres (29 mi). The guns were designed in preparation for the Battle of France, but were not ready for action when the battle began, and in any case the Wehrmacht's Blitzkrieg offensive through Belgium rapidly outflanked and isolated the Maginot Line's World War I-era static defenses, forcing them to surrender uneventfully and making their destruction unnecessary. Gustav was later employed in the Soviet Union at the siege of Sevastopol, where among other things, it destroyed a munitions depot buried in the bedrock under a bay. The guns were moved to Leningrad, and may have been intended to be used in the Warsaw Uprising like other German heavy siege pieces, but the rebellion was crushed before they could be prepared to fire. Gustav was later captured by US troops and cut up, whilst Dora was destroyed near the end of the war to avoid capture by the Red Army.;The gigantic 80-cm K (E) railway guns 'Schwerer Gustav' and 'Dora' owed their origin to a 1935 Wehrmacht study into what would be needed to penetrate the thickness of concrete, being boasted of in French newspapers, in the newly completed Maginot Line and were developed by Krupp AG.
